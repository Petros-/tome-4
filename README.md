# Assignment questions

1) What worked well in this project (what was easy/straightforward)?

The easiest (and possibly most rewarding in some ways?) part of of this project was creating a toggle switch to show or hide artwork titles. Doing that helped me understand the value of how React is designed to be used in a modular way.
  
3) What didn't work well (what was difficult to understand or parse)?

The hardest part of the assignment was creating a test for it. I struggled to figure out how to even approach that, and I'm not sure how much value I'm getting from my one test (testing the delete function). I think I kind of got dropped in the deep end and it took me a fairly long time to figure out how to create it, and what I created in the end I don't fully understand.

4) What changes would you make to this project now that it's deployed?

I'm not sure the way the artworks list loads is actually very sustainable, and I also don't do much to control the size of the app or the size of artwork images within it. It would probably be a lot smarter if I downsized the images or copies of them so that I can keep rendering really fast. I also would like for my loading animation to show up, but it doesn't seem to do that.

5) What would you improve and/or add to this project now that it's deployed?

I really wanted to make a way to tag artworks, and then show all the artworks associated with a given tag. I might still get to it, but if I don't, that's the main thing I would like to achieve next. From there I could create a publically viewable link to those artworks, or I could create a .pdf from them (which is useful in the context of working with galleries).
